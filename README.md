## ToDo Exercise

### Description:
This is a project that I edited for MIT xPRO's web development class. The goal was to refactor the To-Do List in a manner of our choosing, particularly the styling. 

Most of the code was provided for me by MIT xPRO. 
 
I adding styling from Bootstrap for my To-Do list, including the checkboxes. I also edited the code so that when a to-do item is clicked, instead of disappearing immediately, the checkbox is simply toggled. (So clicking an item twice will check and then uncheck it). 
I chose to add this functionality because it's what I would want in a to-do list application (both because it's nice to see everything I've accomplished and in case I accidentally click on an item). I then added a button that clears all checked todos when clicked. 

#### How to Run: 

Download all of the files into a folder. Open the folder in a terminal and type http-server -c1. This will run the index.html file on a local server. (Port 8080).

#### Support:

N/A

#### Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
This could be a fun project to re-factor in the future. I might potentially add a dropdown menu of editable categories (for instance housework, schoolwork, work-work, etc.).
